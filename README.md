Overview
This coursework entails implementing a classifier to control Pacman's movements in the classic game. While the classifier may not significantly improve Pacman's performance, the objective is to develop and utilize it effectively. 
Pacman Setup: Obtain the Pacman code from the provided link and ensure it runs on Python 3.
Control Pacman: Use the provided Pacman code to control Pacman's movements using various agents, including RandomAgent and RandomishAgent.
Classifier Implementation
Utilize the skeleton code provided in pacman-cw1/classifier.py to develop your classifier.
Modify only classifier.py and adhere strictly to the provided skeleton.
The classifier should be trained using data from good-moves.txt to predict Pacman's actions based on the game's state.
Ensure your code interacts with the Pacman environment solely through api.py and complies with the given data format.
Task Guidelines and Restrictions
Your code should be based on Python 3 and compatible with the standard Anaconda Python 3 distribution.
Utilize only the provided classifier.py file and refrain from modifying any other files within the pacman-cw1 directory.
