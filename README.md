# Overview
- This coursework entails implementing a classifier to control Pacman's movements in the classic game. While the classifier may not significantly improve Pacman's performance, the objective is to develop and utilize it effectively.
# Getting Started 
- Pacman Setup: Obtain the Pacman code from the provided link and ensure it runs on Python 3.
- Control Pacman: Use the provided Pacman code to control Pacman's movements using various agents, including RandomAgent.
# Classifier Implementation
- Utilize the skeleton code provided in pacman-cw1/classifier.py to develop your classifier.
- Modify only classifier.py and adhere strictly to the provided skeleton.
- The classifier should be trained using data from good-moves.txt to predict Pacman's actions based on the game's state.
- Ensure your code interacts with the Pacman environment solely through api.py and complies with the given data format.
